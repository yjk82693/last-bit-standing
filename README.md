# Last Bit Standing

A last-player-standing card game about **binary, hex, and ASCII**. You sit at a table with five bot agents. Prompts come from `src/data/questions.json` (easy / medium / hard). Play a matching card for points on the clock. You win if you still have at least 1 of 3 lives and every bot has lost all 3.

## How a round works

1. Six seats. You plus Clippy, Hexa, Bitwise, ASCII-8, and NullPtr. Everyone has **3 lives** and is dealt **7 cards**. Lives carry from round to round.
2. A prompt appears from the question bank — binary, hex, ASCII, and 5-bit letter codes (`00001` is A).
3. Each card shows an encoding on top and Magic-style flavor text underneath. The flavor hints at the value without spelling out the answer.
4. Your seven cards always include the bank answer plus six distractors. Exact encodings score. Near-misses are traps.
5. After the plays, tap any bot whose answer is wrong. That bot loses 1 life. **Two correct calls in a row restore 1 of your lives** (max 3). Tap a bot who was right, or play the wrong card yourself, and **you** lose 1 life. A miss shows the matching card from your hand plus a one-line why. Hard prompts get more clock (135s). The light bulb gives **three hints for the table** (they do not refill). Extra lamps on the same question get more direct; the third is the answer. You still choose any card. The round clock pauses while a hint is open. Wrong bots you skip keep their lives.
6. A player at 0 lives stays on the felt, darkened, with their last play showing. You win with at least 1 life left after every bot is out.
7. The clock does not cost a life. Correct answers score **easy 5 / medium 10 / hard 15**, times a speed multiplier: ≤15s ×2, ≤30s ×1.5, ≤60s ×1.25, slower ×1. Card footnotes on easy rounds print a direct translation; medium keeps flavor; hard hides the line. The title page has an encoding bench with binary / hex / ASCII tables. Finished tables land on a **leaderboard** (wins above falls, then points). Reset board clears it.

## Run locally

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
npm test   # proves every prompt's 7 cards include the bank answer
```

## Grok Voice

The table announcer reads each prompt, calls eliminations (`ASCII 8 eliminated, 5 players remaining`), and says **You win** / **You lose**. Set `XAI_API_KEY` to use [xAI Grok TTS](https://docs.x.ai/developers/model-capabilities/audio/text-to-speech) (`eve` by default). With no key it uses the browser speech engine so the table still talks. Heart-break SFX is local Web Audio — Grok TTS is speech-only.

## Cards and scores (SpacetimeDB)

The live game reads a **Spacetime-shaped catalog** of cards, prompts, and scores.

- Out of the box it uses the bundled seed (`src/lib/catalog.ts`) plus browser scores, so the table is playable on Vercel with no extra service.
- Optional: publish the module in `spacetimedb/` and point the app at your database:

```bash
# Install the SpacetimeDB CLI, then from this repo:
spacetime publish last-bit-standing --project-path spacetimedb
```

```bash
NEXT_PUBLIC_SPACETIMEDB_HOST=wss://maincloud.spacetimedb.com
NEXT_PUBLIC_SPACETIMEDB_DB_NAME=last-bit-standing
```

After generate/bindings, the same `card`, `prompt`, and `score` tables are the source of truth.

## Deploy on Vercel

```bash
npx vercel login
npx vercel --yes --prod --name last-bit-standing
```

No required environment variables. Add the SpacetimeDB host/name above only if you published the module.

## Origin

Last Bit Standing started as a team project at HopHacks 2026
([original repo](https://github.com/Pespinosa2004/ai-language-showdown)).
This fork adds SpacetimeDB multiplayer, accounts, guest mode, ranked ratings and a leaderboard.
